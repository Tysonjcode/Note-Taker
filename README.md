# Unit 11: Express.js Note Taker Application
## Description

The objective of this unit was to create a server-side API using the Express.js framework that uses routing to handle server-side responses to client-side URL requests. The application highlights use of three of the most commonly used HTTP methods, including POST, GET, and DELETE to create a working front-end and back-end application.

In terms of app functionality, it is built to allow users to input and save simple notes or to-do list items, including a title and text for each, and then delete them as necessary.
